> As the fastest growing city in the nation, Seattleâ€™s transportation system is under tremendous stress. Whether we walk, bike, or drive, we all share the same road. However, information about our transportation system is often hard to find and confusing to interested citizens. TransitSphere, built in partnership with Seattle Department of Transportation, serves as a civic guide to the assets SDOT manages. The experience this tool provides allows citizens to learn more about their transit infrastructure in a way that is both approachable and informative.
